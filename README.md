Link to deployed site: https://languagebytes.github.io/Sarah-Lloyd-Portfolio/
For this project, I created a portfolio using HTML and CSS. The page contains a hero section, an about me section, a projects section and a footer. On clicking on a project, the viewer should be directed to the github deployed site. I added in anchor tags to direct the user to the relevant section. When the social icons are clicked, the user should be directed to the relevant pages. As I work in Russia, I have attempted to create a Russian version of the page which on click will direct the user to this page in the footer section. 

## Issues with Flexbox, Alignment and Adding in CV

I struggled a bit with Flexbox here. This is something that I am working on, as on very small screens the page does not change in the way I would like it to. This is something I will work on and go over with my tutor. Moreover, there are some text alignment issues due to anchor tags which I will need to fix and I would like to add in a link to my CV on click of the CV styled button in the next few weeks.
